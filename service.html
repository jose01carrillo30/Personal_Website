                    <h3>The Big Event 2019</h3>
                    <p>We worked with families in Bryan/College Station area to help with various upkeep and clean up activities. My group was tasked with performing yardwork for a grateful resident and his family. It was an amazing chance to see so many students coming together to improve the area and give back to the community!</p>

                    <p>Volunteered at a local Habitat for Humanity, helping organize their warehouse. It was a large effort and hard work, but it was very rewarding to see how a handful of volunteers can make a dramatic improvement in the course of a day. With the warehouse sorted out, people in need from the community will have better access to the home improvement supplies available to them.</p>
